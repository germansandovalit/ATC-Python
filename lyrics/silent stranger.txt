Who are you with the lights out?
I don't feel right when I'm all alone
My human natures makes me a stranger
To everyone I know

I know it's all lies
I brought to life
Now I don't know how to be someone real
Hate that I fake the way that I feel

Voices
Fill my head with noises
Drain me of this poison
Cause I'm not who you think I've been
Frozen
I'm someone I don't know and
The cycles never broken
And I'll die a silent stranger

Feels like I'm hiding in my skin
I'm such a coward and they all know
I'll never let them see my face
Cover my tracks and run away

I know it's all lies
I brought to life
Now I don't know how to be someone real
Hate that I fake the way that I feel

Voices
Fill my head with noises
Drain me of this poison
Cause I'm not who you think I've been
Frozen
I'm someone I don't know and
The cycles never broken
And I'll die a silent stranger

Voices
Fill my head with noises
Drain me of this poison
And I'll die a silent stranger

Voices
Fill my head with noises
Drain me of this poison
Cause I'm not who you think I've been
Frozen
I'm someone I don't know and
The cycles never broken
And I'll die a silent stranger
