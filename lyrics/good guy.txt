I'm feeling like I've had it, I'm so sick
Of playing in your fantasy
You always got the best me, I waited
I hate it
You've got me feeling so weak

Wish I could act the way you do
I break the good you got for something new
But when you got something to lose
You play it cool

First off - it's funny that you call us friends
After all the times when

I've seen your lows, and seen your highs
So drop the good guy
Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me laugh
Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that
I'm driving home with dewy eyes
For the last time
I used to hate you now I think you're sad
Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that

Don't know why I let you
Hold me down
If you wanted an enemy
You found a war in bed with me I'm lethal
And too proud
Won't quit till I've cut you down
You never said you're sorry
But that's alright
You wanna change the story
One more time

I've seen your lows, and seen your highs
So drop the good guy
Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me laugh
Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that
I'm driving home with dewy eyes
For the last time
I used to hate you now I think you're sad
Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that


How to love like that, I think you're so sad
Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that

I've seen your lows, and seen your highs
I can't believe that I felt for it bad
Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that

I've seen your lows, and seen your highs
So drop the good guy
Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me laugh
Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that
I'm driving home with dewy eyes
For the last time
I used to hate you now I think you're sad
Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that

Fuck whoever taught you how to love like that

I've seen your lows, and seen your highs
So drop the good guy
